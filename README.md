# South Coast Summit Workshop

Jess is AMAZING

Repo containing source code for the South Coast Summit Workshop - Build a Hugo Website in Azure using GitHub Actions and Azure Bicep in a day with Dev Containers

We recommend downloading the repo and getting the local demo environment setup on your laptop. This way you can follow along with the demos.

## Prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [`Remote Development` Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

## Setup

1. Download the repo from GitHub
    ```PowerShell
    # change directory to where you'd like the repo to go
    cd C:\GitHub\

    # clone the repo from GitHub
    git clone https://github.com/jpomfret/SCSWorkshop

    # move into the folder
    cd .\SCSWorkshop\

    # open VSCode
    code .
    ```

1. Once code opens, there should be a toast in the bottom right that suggests you 'ReOpen in Container'.
1. The first time you do this it may take a little, and you'll need an internet connection, as it'll download the container images used in our demos
1. Open a pwsh console and start your adventure... (Note it is better in a vanilla pwsh session than in the Integrated Terminal)
