# Lesson 2 - More than Source Control 2

## Repositories

- As well as source control, for keeping your code changes safe and enabling collaboration with branching, forking, cloning, and Pull Requests, GitHub also provides a place to manage your 'project' or 'product' or 'application' or 'solution' or 'whatever you want to call it'.

### Issues

- Issues are a place to track bugs, enhancements, and other things that need to be done. They can be assigned to people, have labels, and be assigned to milestones. They can also be linked to pull requests.

### Wikis

- Wikis are a place to document your project. They can be edited by anyone with access to the repository. They can also be linked to issues and pull requests.

## Projects

- Projects are a place to track your work. You can create a project board and add issues, pull requests, and other things to it. You can also create a Kanban board and add issues, pull requests, and other things to it.
